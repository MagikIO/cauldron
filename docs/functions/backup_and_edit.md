# `backup_and_edit`

[`backup_and_edit`](../../functions/backup_and_edit.fish) is designed to create a backup of a specified file and then open the original file in the user's preferred editor. This utility is particularly useful for making safe changes to configuration files or any important file that you might want to ensure a backup exists before editing.

## Version

- **Version Number:** 1.2.0

## Usage

```shell
backup_and_edit [options] <file>
```

### Parameters

- `file`: The path to the file you wish to backup and edit. This parameter is mandatory.

### Options

- `-v`, `--version`: Displays the version number of the `backup_and_edit` function.
- `-h`, `--help`: Shows the help message, including usage and options.
- `-b`, `--backup`: Only creates a backup of the specified file without opening it for editing.
- `-V`, `--verbose`: Enables verbose output, providing more detailed information during the operation.

## Description

The `backup_and_edit` function automates the process of backing up a file before editing, ensuring that a safety copy is available in case any unintended changes are made. By default, the function will create a backup with the same name as the original file but with an additional `.bak` extension. After creating the backup, the original file is opened in the user's preferred editor for editing.

### Editor Selection

The function attempts to use the editor specified in the `EDITOR` environment variable. If `EDITOR` is not set, it checks for a user-defined preferred editor stored in the `aqua__preferred_editor` variable. If neither is available, it defaults to using Visual Studio Code (`code`) if installed, or `nano` as the last resort.

### Backup Limitation

The current version does not support limiting the number of backup copies. Each execution will create a new backup file if the `-b` or `--backup` option is not used.

## Examples

1. **Backup and Edit a File:**

   To backup and edit a file named `config.yml`:

   ```shell
   backup_and_edit config.yml
   ```

2. **Only Backup a File:**

   To only create a backup of `config.yml` without opening it:

   ```shell
   backup_and_edit -b config.yml
   ```

3. **Verbose Output:**

   To backup and edit `config.yml` with verbose output:

   ```shell
   backup_and_edit -V config.yml
   ```

## Notes

- Ensure that you have write permissions for the directory containing the file you wish to backup and edit.
- The function does not automatically manage or delete old backup files. Users should manually manage backups to avoid clutter.
