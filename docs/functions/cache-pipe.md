# `cache-pipe`

[`cache-pipe`](../../functions/cache-pipe.fish) is designed to cache the output of a pipe command into a temporary file and then move that temporary file to overwrite the source of the pipe. This is particularly useful for operations that require atomic updates to files based on the output of a command.

## Version

1.0.2

## Synopsis

```shell
cache-pipe [options] [file]
```

## Description

`cache-pipe` takes the output of a piped command and writes it to a temporary file. Once the command completes, the temporary file is moved to replace the original file specified as an argument. This ensures that the file update is atomic and reduces the risk of data corruption.

## Options

- `-v`, `--version`: Displays the version number of the `cache-pipe` function.
- `-h`, `--help`: Shows the help message, including usage and options.

## Examples

Caching the output of a simple echo command into a file named `sample.txt`:

```shell
echo 'Hello World' | cache-pipe sample.txt
```

After running the above command, you can display the contents of `sample.txt` to see the output:

```shell
cat sample.txt # => Hello World
```

## Usage

To use `cache-pipe`, simply pipe the output of a command into `cache-pipe` followed by the target file name. The function will handle the creation of a temporary file, writing the piped output to this file, and then atomically moving the temporary file to overwrite the target file.

## Notes

- Ensure that the target file's directory exists, as `cache-pipe` does not create directories.
